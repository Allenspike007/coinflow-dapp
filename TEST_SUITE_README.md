function createTx(account: Account, functionName: string, args: any[] = []): Tx

// Assert successful operation
function assertSuccess(receipt: any, expectedResult?: any)

// Assert error condition
function assertError(receipt: any, expectedError: string)
```

### Test Constants

```typescript
const CONTRACT_NAME = 'coinflow-dapp';
const DEFAULT_BLOCK_TIME = 1000;
```
